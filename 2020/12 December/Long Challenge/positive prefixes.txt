You are given two positive integers N and K, where K≤N. 
Find a sequence A1,A2,…,AN such that:

for each valid i, Ai is either i or −i
there are exactly K values of i such that 1≤i≤N and A1+A2+…+Ai>0
If there are multiple solutions, you may print any one of them. 
It can be proved that at least one solution always exists.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. 
The description of T test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers N and K.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing N space-separated integers A1,A2,…,AN.
